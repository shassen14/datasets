NEW SCREENPLAY:

FADE IN: 

SCENE 1 - INT. MICHAEL 
SCOTT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Michael Scott is sitting behind his desk addressing a job 
seeker. 

SCOTT 
I'm a busy man. When I give jobs, I 
don't have time for a lotta B.S. If a guy 
comes to me and says, "Michael, this job 
has been my dream since I was a little 
kid. My whole life has been leading up 
to this job," ... That, I respond to. 
Nothing is more important than 
enthusiasm, from the Greek word 
meaning ... 'enthusiastic.' Huh? 
He looks to the job seeker, who says nothing. 

SCOTT 
Only problem'is, you 
talk the talk, but 
you don't walk the walk. Okay, that was 
global, I'll make it local: you didn't 
pass your fork-lift driver's test. 
But ... the foreman at the warehouse is a 
personal friend, okay? So don't sweat 
it, you're in. 
He picks up the receiver and dials. 

SCOTT 
{into phone, showing off) 
Deon ... You dog ... Playa! 
He winks at the job seeker. 

SCOTT 
It's "the boss," and when I mean 
Springsteen, I'll just say "God" ... Have 
you put out an ad for the fork-lift 
driver's job? 
Scott crosses his fingers and bites his lip. 

SCOTT 
Good, don't, I've got the guy here, he's 
''the man" ... 
Has he passed his fork-lift 
driver's test? Playa, he gives the 
tests ... 
Scott rolls his eyes. 
SCOTT 
Sure ... Sure. He's first aid-trained, 
sure. Sure ... we'll shoot a resume over 
to you this afternoon. 
Scott mimes for the job seeker to type up a resume. 

SCOTT 
( into phone) 
We still hangin' on Sunday? No, no, no, 
you can't get out of it! ... How's Jill? 
She left ya yet? Sure ... Okay, see you 
then. 
He puts down the phone and grits his teeth. 

SCOTT 
She left him last month, I forgot about 
that. 

SCENE 2 - INT. OPEN-'PLAN OFFICE - DAY 
Scott is showing the camera crew around his office. 

SCOTT 
I've been in the business for twelve 
years. I've been at IDS as general 
manager for eight of those. So, putting 
together my team ... 
Scott notices Pam at the reception. 

SCOTT 
Hey, it's Spam, spam, wonderful Pam. Pam 
Beesly ... Receptionist. How ya doin'? 
Been with us forever, right Pam? 

PAM 
Yeah. 

SCOTT 
Yeah. At one time or another every guy in 
the office has "sprayed on Pam." 

PAM 
(annoyed) 
What? 

SCOTT 
Any messages? 

PAM 
Yeah. Just a fax. 

Pam hands him a fax. 

SCOTT 
Hmm ... Pam, this is from Corporate. 

PAM 
I know ... 

SCOTT 
(somber) 
How many times have I told you? There's 
a special filing cabinet for things from 
Corporate -

PAM 
(worried) 
You haven't told me -

SCOTT 
- it's called the wastepaper basket! 

Scott throws the fax over the counter into Pam's wastepaper 
basket and laughs at the brilliance of his practical joke. 

SCOTT 
The look on your face ... Ha! You'd 
better get that back. 

SCOTT TALKING HEAD - INT - DAY 

SCOTT 
People say I'm the best boss. 
He points to a mug in the foreground with the inscription. 

SCOTT 
"World's Greatest Boss." They go, "Oh, 
we've never worked in a place like this 
before, you're such a riot. You get the 
best out of us." And I go, you know, 
"Que sera, sera." If that's true -
awesome. 
Scott shrugs and looks smugly into camera. 

SCENE 3 - INT. RECEPTION - DAY 

SCOTT 
Take it easy on me today, Pam. 

PAM 
(exasperated) 
Yeah? Why's that? 
SCOTT 
Oh God. Did I party last night. I was 
out with the Packer. Meredith Packster­
Birney. 
(to camera crew) 
Todd Packer. 
(to.Pam) ~ Had us a bar hop. "D f, Duff, that 
wonderful stuff ... " 
Scott mimes drinki::~TT \M~ 
D'oh! I was baked, N~,~to! Wow, 
don't ever come out with me and the Green 
Bay Packer. 

PAM 
No, I won't. 

SCOTT 
There's guys my age, and they look middle­
aged ... How old do you think I look? 

PAM 
Thirty-n--

SCOTT 
(interrupting) 
- Thirty, right ... About that. Oh, man I 
have got to slow down. Drinking a little 
too much ... 
Scott pats his belly. 

SCOTT 
... if every single night of the week is 
too much. 

PAM 
(joking) 
And every lunchtime.· · 
Beat. Scott turns suddenly, a cold look in his eyes. 

SCOTT 
How many have I had this week? 

PAM 
What? 


SCOTT 
How many beers have I drunk this week? 
If you're counting ... 

PAM 
I'm not counting. 

SCOTT 
You seem to be counting. Does it offend 
you, huh? You know, that's getting a 
little ... a little bit personal. What if 
I started doing that with you? I could 
look at you and come out with something 
clever like, "You're really ... uh ... " 
He 
can't think of anything. 

SCOTT 
... but I don't. Because I'm a 
professional and professionalism is ... 
uh ... And th'at is 
what I want, okay? 
That's all. I'm disappointed, Pam. I 
really am. 
He strides off, leaving Pam speechless. 

SCENE 

NT - OPEN-PLAN OFFICE - DAY 

Shots of office life. Jim is working. Dwight arrives and 
smacks Jim upside the head with a newspaper. 

DWIGHT 
Wassaaaaap? 
Jim looks indignant. 

JIM 
Oh, fu ... Don't do that, Jesus ... 

DWIGHT 
Aw, what's the matter? Is it your time 
of the month? Whew. Just-ten 
brewskis 
for me last night. Yeah, that's all. 
(burps) 
Uhhhh. 
Dwight pretends to find a headline in his newspaper. 

DWIGHT ~ Oh, no! Here it is! "IS team leader 
caught out drinking wit boss ... Senior 
management completely trashed" Whew. 
And tonight I'm going out with Animal. 
(MORE) 
DWIGHT (cont'd) 
Yeah, we're just gonna go to the library 
and read - not! I doubt it! 

JIM TALKING HEAD - INT - DAY 

JIM 
I'm a sales rep, which means that my job 
is to speak to clients on the phone about 
er ... quantity and type of paper - whether 
we can supply it to them and whether they 
can pay for it ... and I'm boring myself 
talking about it .. . 

SCENE 5 - INT - DESK AREA - DAY 
Scott emerges from his office, smiling. 

SCOTT 
Wassaaaap? 

JIM 
Hey! 'Wassaaaap?' I still love that. 

SCOTT 
Wassaaaap? Ohhh. 
Points at Dwight. 

SCOTT 
You're fired, Schrute, ya big drunk. 
Scott points to himself, laughing. 

SCOTT 
Pot calling the kettle black here. 
Scott mimes vomiting and then starts., /4gling. Dwight 
joins in. ~ti,'-

SCOTT 
What'd 
he tell you It's all true. 
Guilty as a futh mucker. ·Went out 
with 
a few of his er w last night. He goes, 
"Well, you can come if you want, but I 
gotta warn you, Michael, they can get 
rowdy.11 I go, "Oh, I'll see if I can 
handle it.11 I was worse than them by the 
end, wasn't I? They're going, "Who's that freak?" "That's my boss.
11 "Well we 
can't stand it any more, we' re leaving.'' 
They just snuck out, didn't they? 


DWIGHT 
(aside to Jim) 
I told you. 

SCOTT 
Outrageous! 

Scott puts one hand round his throat, another reaching out 
in front of him as if dying. 

SCOTT 
Help me, A.A! 
Scott laughs, waiting for a response. There is none. 

SCOTT 
What? 

JIM 
Nothing. 

SCOTT 
... See you later. 

JIM 
Okay, see you later. Take care. 

SCENE"~\~~ -RECEPTION -DAY 
Jan Tarnovsky-Gould approaches Pam at reception. Scott's 
talking head begins over this. 

SCOTT TALKING HEAD - INT - DAY 

SCOTT 
Corporate doesn't really interfere with 
me at all. Jan Tarnovsky-Gould. I call 
her, er ... Ruth Bader-Ginsburg, heh heh -
not to her face ... but not because I'm 
scared of her. 

SCENE 7 -INT -
SCOTT'S OFFICE - · ·DAY 
Jan and Scott are sitting in Scott's office. Pam comes in 
and sits down. Scott is discussing his tie. 

SCOTT 
I got them off an African guy, you know, 
had a suit-case out on the street. Two 
for ten bucks. "Yo, I'll 
take four." 
So 
... okay. Meeting with Jan Tarnovsky­
Gould. Present. Jan takes some papers from her bag. She crosses her legs 
and Scott sneaks a look. 

SCOTT 
(lascivious) 
Mmrn. Shoot! 

JAN 
Was there anything that you wanted to add 
to the agenda? 

SCOTT 
(trying to be cool) 
Me no get an agenda. 

JAN 
Sorry? 

SCOTT 
I did not get any agenda. 
, , 

JAN 
I faxed you one this morning. 

SCOTT 
No, we never got a fax, did we Pam? 

PAM 
Well, maybe ... 

SCOTT 
(passing the buck) 
Then why isn't it in my hand? Because a 
company runs on efficiency of 
communication. 

PAM 
You put it in the garbage can that was a 
special filing cabinet. 

SCOTT 
(to Jan, covering himself) 
As a joke, yeah. It's not even my joke, 
it's my brother's joke and it's supposed 
to be with bills. Doesn't work great 
with faxes. 

JAN 
Do you want to look at mine? 

SCOTT 
(humbled) 
Yeah. 


SCOTT TALKING HEAD - INT - DAY 

SCOTT 
Yeah, sure, she'd say she's the boss, but 
there shouldn't be any ego when you're 
pulling together to do something good, 
y'know? It's like Comic Relief. I'm out 
here in Africa and I'm seeing the flies 
and the starvation ... and she - if she is 
the boss - she's in the studio with, you 
know, Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg. 
They're doing their job, they're counting 
the money. Good for them. But, their 
hands are clean, while I'm down here in 
the office with the little starving 
kids ... 

SCENE 8 - INT. 
SCOTT'S OFFICE - DAY 

JAN 
Okay, since ~he last 
meeting, Alan and 
the board have decided that we can't 
justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford 
branch. 

SCOTT 
(obviously flustered) 
Oh, okay, go on ... 

JAN 
No, no, listen, Michael, don't panic -

SCOTT 
- Oh, go on. Should be good. This is 
it. Go on -

JAN 
- No, listen, Michael, no, no, no -

SCOTT 
- Alarm bells, so -

JAN 
- No, don't panic ... We haven't made any -

SCOTT 
- I don't panic -

JAN 
- We haven't made any decisions yet -

SCOTT 
- Good -


JAN 
- I've spoken to Josh in Stamford -

SCOTT 
- Yeah -

JAN 
- I've told him the same as you. And 
it's up to either you or him to convince 
me that your branch could incorporate the 
other. 

SCOTT 
- Okay, no problem -

JAN 
This does, however, mean that there is 
going to be downsizing. 

SCOTT 
Oh, you see,· ·me no 
want to hear that, 
Jan, because downsizing is a bitch. It is 
a real bitch. I wouldn't wish that on 
Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it 
on my men. Or women. Present company 
excepted. Is Josh concerned about 
downsizing? 

JAN 
Well he is, of course, yes. 

SCOTT 
Good. Because I'm very concerned about 
downsizing, although I understand if it's 
absolutely necessary, as a businessman, then it has to be ... Does he understand 
if it's -

JAN 
(stopping him) 
- Michael -

SCOTT 
- Go on -

JAN 
- Can we not talk about downsizing? -

SCOTT 
Well, we have to sooner or later -


JAN 
( stopping him) 
- Yes, but at the moment, what we have to 
decide is, do you take on Stamford's 
people at this branch or the other way 
round? 

SCOTT 
We'll take on theirs. 

JAN 
No -

SCOTT 
No? 

JAN 
- No, you and I don't decide. I decide. 

SCOTT 
You do decide, but -

JAN 
I decide once you've made your case -
SC~TT -based 
on fac_ rs. 
Okay. 
time limit o ... ? Is there a 
Scott's desk phone rings. His answer machine kicks in. 

SCOTT 
I'll just screen it. 

SCOTT'S VOICE 
Hi, I'm not available, so please leave a 
massage. 
TODD PACKER 
(on phone) 
Alright, Mikey, it's the Packer. What's 
going on? 

SCOTT 
( showing off) 
Todd Packer. Terrific rep. 
TODD PACKER 
I hear you've got a hangover, you big 
fag. 

SCOTT 
Oh, that's not good. That's derogatory. 

TODD PACKER 
Call me back. Hey, you're in with that 
Jan what's-her-face today, aren't you? 
Give her a pork from me, dude. 

SCOTT 
( embarrassed) 
Oh ... Awful, awful man. 

JAN 
Can we keep a lid on this for the time 
being? I really don't want to worry 
people unduly. 

SCOTT 
No worries. Under this regime, this will 
not leave the office. 
He mimes zipping his mouth shut. As soon as he has said 
this we cut to a mon~age of 
different employees discussing 
the news. 
ANGLE ON DONNA 
DONNA 
So what does downsizing actually mean? 
ANGLE ON EMMA AND 
KEVIN 
EMMA 
So, you'd just go, would you? 

KEVIN 
Would you? 
EMMA 1 ~J)~ 
Oh I I dunno. vo~-
ANGLE ON 
JIM AND 
PAM 
Jim is discussing things with Pam. 

JIM 
Kevin and Donna and all the others are 
having these -

PAM 
Yeah, I know, they're all going nuts, 
aren't they? 

JIM 
- weird sort of secret pow-wows -
PAM 
I actually don't 

JIM give~) you? 
"''----~ 
- "Oh, no, we're gonna lose our jobs." I 
could care less. 
Pam holds up her pinkie finger. Jim holds up his and they 
give a little pinkie finger shake on it. (Or some other 
tiny piece of ad-libbed flirtation.) 

PAM TALKING HEAD -INT 

PAM 
I hope they do get rid of me ... Because 
then I might actually get off my ass and 
do something. Um, I don't think it's 
many little girls' dream to be a 
receptionist. I used to do illustrations. 
Mostly watercolor, a few oil pencils ... 
Jim thinks they're good. 
Maybe they 
are ... I just don't want to be treading 
water, you know, and then wake up in 
another five years and say, "shoot, done 
it again." 

SCENE 9 - INT. DESK AREA - DAY 
Dwight is sitting at his desk, playing with some chewing 
gum in his mouth. He notices the camera and puts the gum 
in the garbage as discreetly as possible. He goes back to 
his work. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Pam is introducing Ryan, a young temp, to Scott. 

PAM 
This is Mr. Scott. 

SCOTT 
Guilty. 

RYAN 
Hey. 
Scott gives a "Who are you?" expression. 

RYAN 
Ryan Howard, from the temping agency. 
Daniqua sent me down to start today. 
SCOTT 
Just a temp ... Howard? Like Moe Howard? 
Stooges, man. 

With lighting wit, Scott snaps into an impersonation of The Three Stooges. 

SCOTT 
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! Moe! Gimme five. 
( off Pam's look) 
It's a guy thing, Pam. Who was the one 
before Shemp? 

RYAN 
Curly? 

SCOTT 
Right. Curly Joe Dorita. 

RYAN 
Just Curly. ~oe Dorita's different. 

SCOTT 
Hey -- comedy's kind of my thing, so ... 
Here's Curly Joe: 
(Curly voice) 
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! 
Ryan laughs politely. 

SCOTT TALKING HEAD - INT - DAY 

SCOTT 
What upsets me about the job? Wasted 
talent. People could come to me, and 
they could say, "Excuse me, Michael, but you've been in the business twelve years. Can you tell us how to manage a team, how 
to keep them happy as well as moving towards the goal posts?" But they don't. 
That's the tragedy. 
Scott shrugs as if it hurts to be a martyr, but he can take 
it. 
INT. DESK AREA - DAY 
Jim is on the phone. Some of Jim's possessions have 
slipped across onto Dwight's desk, and Dwight is pushing 
them back with a ruler. He slides it between his and Jim's 
desks to clarify just where the dividing line is. This is 
too much for Jim. 
JIM 
Yeah ... Look, Mr. Davis, I'm gonna have 
to call you back. Something's just come 
up. Two minutes. Thanks very much. 
Bye. 
Jim puts down the phone. 

JIM 
(to Dwight) 
What are you doing? 

DWIGHT 
What? 

JIM 
Dwight, what are you doing? 

DWIGHT 
I'm just pushing your stuff off my desk, 
I can't conc·entrate when ... 

JIM 
It's not on your desk. 

DWIGHT 
It was, it's all overlapping. It's all 
coming over the edge here. 
Jim buries his head in his hands. 

DWIGHT 
One word, two syllables: De-mar-cation. 
INT. OPEN-PLAN OFFICE - DAY 

Ryan is being led through the office by Michael Scott. 
Scott grins excitedly and points out a 'Homer Simpson' doll 
impaled on a coat stand. He waits for a big laugh. Ryan 
looks at him calmly. Unfazed, he continues. 

SCOTT 
This is the accounting department. The 
number dudes. Don't let the job 
descriptions fool ya. They are all 
completely crazy. 
(pointing to Kevin) 
Especially that one. He's a mental 
patient. Not literally, of course, that 
wouldn't work. The last place you'd want 
someone like that is in accounting ... 

Scott crouches behind an office plant and peers through the 
leaves. 

SCOTT 
"Veddy interesting .... But shtoopid!" 
Artie Johnson. I do that to cheer 'em 
up. We send the girls out to get the 
plants. You know, it makes them a little 
bit happier, because they can sometimes 
get a little ... 
He mimes 'depressed.' Scott leans over to a novelty fish 
mounted on the wall and presses the button. Nothing 
happens. 

SCOTT 
Oh, the batteries are dead. C'mon people! 
(to an employee) 
Can you get some batteries for 'Billy 
Bigmouth?' Take it out of petty cash. 
(to camera crew) 
You 
can't put a price on comedy. 
INT. DESK AREA - DAY 

JIM 
You're a scrotum, Dwight. You're a 
scrotum and a dildo. 

DWIGHT 
I'm still not listening, so it's not 
offending me, so ... 

JIM 
Right, okay, so you won't hear this -
you're a tool, you're a tool, you're a 
tool. 
Dwight ignores him. 

JIM 
You're a tool. 

DWIGHT TALKING HEAD - INT. - DAY 

DWIGHT 
Yeah, it's okay here, but people 
sometimes take advantage, because it's so 
relaxed. You know, I'm a volunteer 
Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends and you 
can't screw around there. That's sort of 
one of the rules. 

INT. OPEN-PLAN OFFICE 
- DAY 
Shots of people working, then cut to: Ryan's induction is 
still underway. Scott points out a sketch pinned to a 
board. 

SCOTT 
Cartoons. "Does my butt look big in 
this?n Now, 
don't worry, that's not 
sexist, 'cause the man is sayin 
it ... finally! So, props for that ... 
props for that in the workplace. 
Dwight walks by, stirring a cup of coffee. 

SCOTT 
Ooh, careful, watch out for this guy! 
Dwight Schrute in the building! 
(making the introductions) 
Ryan, the ne~ temp. 

DWIGHT 
Hey. 

RYAN 
Good 
to see you. 

SCOTT 
Introduce yourself. 

DWIGHT 
Uh ... Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional 
Manager. 

SCOTT 
Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
Scott points to himself. 

SCOTT 
Dwight's my right-hand man, immediately 
beneath me .. as the priest said to the 
altar boy! Bill Maher. Not his line, 
but in 
the style of. 
(Ryan stares at him.) 
Of course, there's nothing wrong with 
that, if you're gay. I mean, not that 
I'm asking, I'm not allowed to ask if 
you're gay ... or Catholic. And if you're Catholic, well ... it's actually word for 
word a Bill Maher line, so don't blame 
me. Over here is the kitchen ... Scott steers Ryan into a little room with a coffee maker 
and accessories. 

SCOTT 
We provide tea bags, sugar, stirrers, 
creamer, the works. Oh, coffee tax. I 
collect a coffee tax to pay for better 
coffee. Starbucks, man. Only the 'Bucks 
will do! So 
... How 'bout, fifty cents to 
start? 
He holds his hand out. There is an uncomfortable pause. 

SCOTT 
(he half-glances to camera) 
It's usually more, but ... 

Finally, Ryan takes out some money and gives it to Scott. 
INT. DESK AREA - DAY 
Jim is taping something. Dwight appears and demands his 
tape back by holding out his hand. Jim slaps it. 

JIM 
Hey soul brother. 

DWIGHT 
Give it back. 

JIM 
I'm just using it for a second. 
Dwight snatches the tape back. It has his name written on 
it in Wite-Out. 

DWIGHT 
It's got my name on it. 'Dwight.' 

JIM 
Uh, actually it says, 'Dwig,' but -

DWIGHT 
If you want to borrow it, just gotta ask. 

JIM 
Dude, you always say "no." What's 
the 
point? 

DWIGHT 
Maybe that's why you should ask. 
JIM 
Dwight, it was just there, okay? 

DWIGHT 
Yeah? That's its home. Leave it there. 
Dwight puts the tape dispenser back in its proper place. 

JIM 
Okay ... Okay ... Okay ... 
Driven to desperate measures, Jim snatches the tape 
dispenser and runs to the window. 

DWIGHT 
(panicked) 
Somebody stop him! Dammit, that's mine! 
Jim holds the tape dispenser out of the window. 

JIM 
You 
stay where you are, okay? I'm gonna 
let this go, okay, unless you stop acting 
like a tool. 

DWIGHT 
Yeah, like you will ... 

JIM 
Yeah, like I did ... 
Jim lets go of the tape dispenser. 

DWIGHT 
What if that kills someone? 

JIM 
Kills somebody? Umrn, well, they'll think 
you're the murderer. It's got your name 
on it. 

DWIGHT 
Why would a murderer put his name on 
murder weapon? 
Because hef;Man impossib'-~ying prick? / anno 

DWIGHT 
(calling) 
Michael! 


JIM 
I hate what ... I hate the fact that you 
bring me down to this; I really do, I 
resent it. 

DWIGHT 
(pointing to an employee) 
I don't know why you're laughing. 

JIM 
Leave her out of it. Go on, Jessica, 
keep it up. Listen, you bring me down to 
this, "Dwig." 
They wander back to their desks, bickering. 
INT. RECEPTION SEATING AREA - DAY 

Pam is sitting on a chair eating a sandwich and reading a 
book. Scott enters. 

SCOTT 
Hiya. What's that? 
Scott examines the book cover. 
Silence. 
SCOTT 
'Wired.' John Belushi. Funny? 

PAM 
It's okay. 

SCOTT 
Freaked myself out this morning. 

PAM 
Oh yeah? 
Scott nods and fingers his genitals. 

SCOTT 
Thought I found a lump. I mean, I 
examine the jewels every month, but this 
felt different ... Turns out it's fine ... 
But freaky, man, "testicular cancer" 
... cancer of them old testicles ... 
Scott points at the sandwich that Pam no longer feels like 
eating. 
SCOTT 
What's that? 

PAM 
Smoked turkey. ~ Fro!ci~: Starbucks ... ? \'SP 
PAM 
Mnun ... 

SCOTT 
Oh. See you later. 
Pam looks queasy and puts the rest of her sandwich down. 
INT. DESK AREA - DAY 
Jim is building a wall of box files between his desk and 
Dwight's. Dwight appears. 

JIM 
(to 
camera crew) 
I don't like acting like a kid, you know 
what I mean? But he's ... 

DWIGHT 
What are you doing? 

JIM 
To be honest, I don't want to have to 
look at you, Dwight. 

Dwight sits down at his desk and is gradually obscured by 
the wall of files that Jim is building. 

DWIGHT 
You can't do that. 

JIM 
Why not? 

DWIGHT 
Health and safety. 
Jim laughs and gives a despairing look to camera. 

JIM 
Health and safety. Uh huh, why? 
"Crushed by cardboard," or what? 
DWIGHT 
No, number one: blocking out light. 
Number two: misuse of company files. 

JIM 
Misuse of files. 
(snapping, turning to camera) 
Yeah, see, this is why the whole 
downsizing thing doesn't bother me. 
Dwight's little face pops up from behind the 'wall.' 

DWIGHT 
Downsizing? 

JIM 
Because if I have to work with him 
another day ... 
(stressed face) 
I'm just goi~g to ... 

DWIGHT 
Here? Downsizing? 

JIM 
I will ... I will slit my throat. 
As he says this, he mimes a slitting motion across his 
throat. Dwight chips in. 

DWIGHT 
Yeah, you won't do it like that, though. 
Gotta get the knife in behind the 
windpipe, then pull it down like that. 

JIM 
Or I could just apply for another job. 
INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY 

Employees are gathering in the meeting room. They pull up 
chairs as Scott addresses them. · · 

SCOTT 
Okay, 
thanks for coming in ... This'll 
only take a minute. I am aware of the 
rumors that have been circulating and I 
just want to take this opportunity to set 
the record straight. 
DWIGHT 
(leaping up, interrupting) 
Ah-ah-ah, I'm the team leader, I should 
know first. 

SCOTT 
Yeah, I'm telling everyone now, Dwight, 
s ... 

DWIGHT 
(interrupting) 
Just tell me very quickly. Just whisper 
it to me. 
EMPLOYEE 
(out of shot) 
Can't you just tell us? 
Other employees chime in. 
DW!GHT 
Yeah, alright, alright. 
(to Scott) 
Should I tell 'em? 

SCOTT 
You don't know what it is. 

DWIGHT 
Alright, you tell them then. With my 
permission. 

SCOTT 
I don't need your permission. 

DWIGHT 
Permission granted. Use it as you wish. 

SCOTT 
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to 
enforce an ultimatum upon me, and Jan is 
talking about either downsizing the 
Stamford branch or this branch. 
(Murmurs of unease) 

STANLEY 
And you're gonna let her? 

SCOTT 
No, Stanley, you didn't see me in there 
with her. 
(aside} 
(MORE) 


SCOTT (cont'd) 
For his eyes only ... 
(back to room) 
I said, "If Corporate 
wants to come 
here and interfere, they've got to go 
through me. You can go and mess with 
Josh's people, but I'm the head of this 
family. You ain't messin' with my 
chillun. I am, if any one's going to." 
EMPLOYEE 
Yeah, but Michael, what if they do 
downsize here? 

SCOTT 
Not gunna happen. 

STANLEY 
It could be out of your hands, Michael. 

SCOTT 
It won't be out of my hands, Stanley, 
okay? That's· a promise. 

STANLEY 
Oh ... can you promise that? 

DWIGHT 
On his mother's grave. 

SCOTT 
(non-committal, to Dwight) 
Well. .. 
(to Stanley) 
I have promised it, okay, and it's an 
insult to me that you still have to ask. 

STANLEY 
It's just that we need to know ... 

SCOTT 
Sorry, Stanley, Pam wants to speak ... 
Your turn Pam. 

PAM 
It's just that I was in the meeting with 
Jan and she said that it could be this 
branch that gets the ax. 
Murmurs of unease. 

SCOTT 
Well, if you were in the meeting with 
Jan, then maybe you should ... 

He mimes zipping his mouth closed. 

SCOTT 
... stick to the ongoing confidentiality 
agreement ... of ... meetings. 

DWIGHT 
(also miming mouth zipping) 
Yeah, information is power! 

STANLEY 
So you can't say for sure whether it's 
going to be us or them, can you? 

SCOTT 
Look. This is my ship and I am asking 
you to trust me and you can't go wrong. 

STANLEY 
Oh, Michael, it's not a question of 
trust... · · 

SCOTT 
It 
is a question of trust, Stanley. 
Yeah, yeah, it is a question of trust. 

STANLEY 
It's communication ... 

SCOTT 
Do you trust me? Do you trust me? Yes 
or no. 

STANLEY 
Yes, I trust you. 

SCOTT 
He does. So ... meeting adjourned. 

DWIGHT 
Good. Excellent. 
Everyone starts to leave. 

DWIGHT 
I would have said practically the same 
thing, in fact I'd have chaired a very 
similar ... Can I just ask, do you trust 
me? Hands up if you trust me. 

SCOTT 
You don't have to ... 


DWIGHT 
Yeah, well, you asked them. 
One girl has put her hand up. 

SCOTT 
Put your hand down. 

DWIGHT 
No, I need to know. I'm Assistant 
Regional Manager. 

SCOTT 
Assistant to the Regional Manager. 
They're going. 

DWIGHT TALKING HEAD - INT. - DAY 

DWIGHT 
I'm not worried about me - I'll be 
alright - if' ·there's going 
to be 
downsizing, then so be it. That's just 
natural selection. In the wild, some 
people wouldn't survive. I mean, you 
know, imagine a warehouse where a little 
midget fella is driving a forklift. He 
can't see over the top, he's got great 
big platform shoes on so he can reach the 
pedals, because of his little legs. I 
mean, Tony's a sweet guy, don't get me 
wrong, but should he be working here? 

SCENE 25 - INT. DESK AREA - DAY 

Dwight, unseen behind Jim's wall of box files, is asking 
him a question. 

DWIGHT 
Have you got a price for matt-coated 
SRA!? 

JIM 
If I can't see you, I can't hear you, 
Dwight. 
Dwight peers over the 'wall.' 

DWIGHT 
Just tell me, will you? 

JIM 
No, I can't hear you. If you want to 
speak to me ... 
DWIGHT 
I'm right here, just tell me now. 

JIM 
... if you want to speak to me, then call 
me, okay? 

Dwight sits back down, and dials Jim's number. Jim's phone 
rings, but he doesn't answer it. 

DWIGHT 
(from behind wall) 
It's on voice-mail. 

JIM 
Leave a message. 

DWIGHT 
Hi. It's me, Dwight. I need a price on 
matt-coated ... Oh, this is stupid . . . 

JIM 
Yeah it is ... This is stupid. It's so ... 
Sorry, dude, what do you want? 
While Dwight is answering, Jim creeps away unseen. 
Pause. 
DWIGHT 
Uh ... I need a tonnage price on matt­
coated SRAl. So I've got three sixty 
down here, but I'm sure that isn't right, 
'cos when I spoke to Dave, earlier on, 
he ... 

DWIGHT 
Okay, I know you're not theie ... 
and 
obviously you can't hear that, but I'm 
not talking to myself, because they're 
filming. 
Pause. Dwight's head pops up - to check Jim's gone. 
INT. RECEPTION SEATING AREA - DAY 
Jim is seated. Pam runs her fingers through his hair, 
trying to arrange it. 

JIM 
That feels nice. Do some with your 
nails. Pam 
Pam 
PAM 
Sure. 
finishes. 

JIM 
This could be a new career, Pam. 
laughs. 

PAM 
There's no difference, is there? You 
actually can't do anything with your hair 
at all. 

JIM 
Hmm, you noticed. 
INT. OPEN-PLAN OFFICE - DAY 
Scott leads Ryan the·temp over to a storeroom. 

SCOTT 
And this here is the gym. 
Inside is a single old Stairmaster. 

RYAN 
You work out? 

SCOTT 
I used to on this all the time, then I 
stopped and then I sold it to the 
employees for the gym. Which reminds 
me ... Workout tax. A bargain at ... one 
dollar. 
He holds out his hand. 

RYAN 
I usually run in the mornings. 

SCOTT 
Fine. I'll cover you this week. You can 
owe me. 
INT. RECEPTION - DAY 
Pam and Jim are flirting. 

JIM 
You like a drink? 


PAM 
Yeah. 

JIM 
At the end of the week? 

PAM 
Yeah. 

JIM 
Well, this is why we're all going out, so 
we can have an -

PAM 
When are we going out? 

JIM 
- end of the week drink. 

PAM .. So when are we going out? 

JIM 
Well, tonight, hopefully, I thought. 
Pam's fiance, Roy, appears. He is holding something 
wrapped in a black garbage bag under his arm. Jim 
immediately steps back from Pam's desk. 

ROY 
(to Jim) 
Hey, man. 

PAM 
Hi. 

ROY 
(to Pam) 
Hi, baby, you ready, yeah? 

PAM 
Yeah. Uh ... would you mind, if I went out 
for a drink with these guys? 

ROY 
No, no, no. Come on, let's go home, 
yeah? 

PAM 
Okay, I'll ... I'll be a couple of 
minutes, 'cos it's only twenty past five. 


JIM 
(to Roy} 
You should come, man. You know, we're 
all going -- get a chance to see what 
people are like outta the office, it'll 
be fun. 

ROY 
No, sounds good, man, but seriously, we 
gotta get going. 

JIM 
Okay. 

Pam trots off. Roy and Jim stand in silence, nothing to 
say to each other. The silence becomes tortuous. Finally, 
Jim tries to make conversation. 

JIM 
Um, what's i~ the bag? 

ROY 
Just tell her I'll see her later, okay? 

JIM 
Sure, will do. Okay. Awesome. Take care. 
Jim nods. Roy leaves. We zoom in to watch Jim's face. 
INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY 
Ryan and Scott are sitting in the meeting room. 

SCOTT 
The dreaded first day. 

RYAN 
Yeah. 

SCOTT 
Everything cool? 

RYAN 
Everything's cool. 

SCOTT 
Have you felt the vibe yet? We work 
hard, we play hard. Play hard when we 
should be working hard sometimes, partly 
my fault, sure. 
(MORE} 
SCOTT (cont'd) 
I let them get away with murder, which I 
know means they let me get away with 
murder ... you know, the girls love me, 
but ... not in that way ... but, er, you 
know. 
(He thinks about it and decides maybe they do.) 

SCOTT 
I guess I've created an atmosphere here 
where I'm a friend first, boss second. 
And probably an entertainer third. 
There is a knock at the door. 

SCOTT 
(call out) 
Just a sec! 
(to Ryan) 
You like the Jamie Kennedy Experiment? 

RYAN 
Yeah. 

SCOTT 
You like Punk'd? Okay, watch this. Don't 
give me away. 
(calls out) 
Come in! 
Pam comes in. 

SCOTT 
(to Ryan) 
... and then Corporate said, yeah, so 
that' 11 be ... 

PAM 
You got a fax. 

SCOTT 
Thanks. Oh, don't go, Pam, can you pull 
up a chair? I was going ·to call you in, 
anyway, it'll be quick. 

She sits down. Before Scott goes on, she glances behind her 
and the camera follows her gaze to see Jim laughing with 
some office workers who are putting on coats and preparing 
to go out. Pam looks after them wistfully. 

SCOTT 
Um, as you are aware, there is going to 
be downsizing, and you've made my life 
easier ... Pam smiles. 

SCOTT 
... in that I'm going to have to let you 
go first. 

PAM 
(shocked) 
What? Why? 

SCOTT 
Why? Theft. Stealing. 

PAM 
Stealing? Er ... Um ••• what am I supposed 
to have stolen? 

SCOTT 
Post-It notes. 

PAM 
Post-It notes? What are they worth, like 
fifty cents? 

SCOTT 
Oh, got a bible there, Ryan? "Thou shalt 
not steal unless it's only worth fifty 
cents." You steal a thousand Post-It 
notes at fifty cents, and you've made ... 
uh ... a profit ... margin. 

PAM 
Why would I steal Post-It notes? 

SCOTT 
I don't know. To make the little things 
on the end of the joints. 

RYAN 
Roaches? 

SCOTT 
Roaches. 
(to Pam) 
Caught you, you drug addict! No, only 
joking. 

PAM 
Are you serious? 

SCOTT 
Yeah. 


PAM 
I can't believe ... God ... I've never even 
stolen a paper clip. And now you're 
firing me. 

SCOTT 
And the good news is, I don't need to 
give you any severance pay 'cos it's 
gross misconduct. So, you can go clear 
your desk. 

Pam starts crying. The joke has seriously backfired. [The 
"World's Greatest Boss" mug is visible on his desk.] Scott 
looks pained and anxious; Ryan doesn't know where to look. 

SCOTT 
Oh, now ... that was the joke there. See? 
You've been "Xed", punk. We were doing a 
joke, him and me ... Morale boost. 
Settling him .in .. . 
(looking· at the faxes} 
Uh, thanks for the faxes ... Guess I'll do 
these n--

PAM 
We all hate you. 

SCOTT 
Come on. 

PAM 
No one respects you. You're a sad little 
man. 

SCOTT 
(doesn't believe her) 
Really? Didn't know that. 
They sit in silence. It is painfully quiet for what seems 
like forever. Finally Pam leaves. Scott's talking head 
begins. 

SCOTT TALKING HEAD - INT. - DAY 

SCOTT 
What is the single most important thing 
for a company? Is it the building? Is 
it the inventory? Is it the cashflow? 
Nuh uh. It's the people. My proudest 
moment here wasn't when I increased 
profits by seventeen per cent, or cut 
expenses without losing a single 
employee. No. 
(MORE) 
SCOTT (cont'd) 
It was a young Guatemalan guy, first job 
in the country, barely spoke English, but 
he came to me and he went, "Mr. Scott, 
will you be the Godfather to my child." 
He nods, smugly. Beat. 

SCOTT 
Didn't happen in the end. We had to let 
him go, he sucked. 
CLOSING MUSIC & END CREDITS, THEN: 
TAG 
INT. OFFICE 

The camera is by the exit, spying back. In zoom, we see the 
bathroom door. Pam hurries out, dabbing her eyes. She is 
surprised to see Jim still at his desk. Everyone else is 
gone. 

PAM 
You still here? How come you didn't go 
out with everybody? 

JIM 
(waves at computer) 
Ah, I gotta enter these orders before I 
can leave. 

PAM 
Oh ... Well, uh, see you Monday? 

JIM 
Yeah. Take care. 
She leaves towards the camera. Jim turns back to his 
computer. Just before Pam passes, we hear an unmistakeable computer game sound effect from Jim's computer in the 
background. Pam smiles as she passes the camera. We zoom in 
on Jim as he plays Bookworm to kill Friday night. 

The End.
