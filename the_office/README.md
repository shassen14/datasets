## main_script.txt

USE THIS ONE. This screenplay was found and copied from https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=574. This screenplay needs to be cleaned up from errors and also episodes needs to be moved around out of order for a better training/validation set.

## side_script.txt

DO NOT USE THIS ONE (dataset too small). Screenplays that I found from random pdf files from the internet and wanted to convert to `.txt`. If able to find a dataset of screenplays, maybe one day convert to into one `.txt` file. Unfortunately haven't found nice screenplays to work with.

## test_script.txt

Just a sample text that gets produced from [the_offic_pdf_to_txt.py](../scripts/the_office_pdf_to_txt.py). Whatever sample text I worked with gets produced here.
