FADE IN:

INT. OFFICE – MORNING

MICHAEL enters and stops by PAM’S desk.

MICHAEL
Morning, Pam. Did you catch the ‘L Word’
last night?

PAM
No. I missed it.

MICHAEL
It was a great episode. Tim found out
that Jenny was cheating on him with
Marina, and Dana and Lara broke up. But
the whole thing was totally unbelievable.

PAM
Why?

MICHAEL
Because. There’s no way that lesbians
are that hot in real life. I know that
we all have our fantasies about a pair
of hot lesbian chicks making out with
each other, but that’s just not how it
is in the real world.

PAM
Um, o-kay.

MICHAEL
I mean, seriously, Pam. There’s no way
in a million years that a smoking hot
lesbian babe would come up to you and
ask you out on a date. It just wouldn’t
happen. I mean, I’m sure you must be
very attractive to plenty of lesbians
out there, but let’s face facts: they
don’t look like Jennifer Beals, they
look like Rosie O’Donnell.

MICHAEL (cont’d)
That’s why the ‘L Word’ is just a TV
show, and this is real life. And Pam,
for what it’s worth, if you were a
lesbian, you’d be one of the hotter
ones.

PAM
Um, thanks.
As Michael heads for his office, Pam turns to the camera.
Her expression asks, “Did he just say that?”

END TEASER

INT. OFFICE - DAY
It’s business as usual, when the entrance of an extremely
attractive young woman (MARCI) interrupts the office’s
normal placid calm.
She approaches Pam’s desk.

MARCI
Hi, is this the paper place?

PAM
Um, yeah. Dunder Mifflin. May I help
you?

MARCI
Oh, great! I found the right office.
(immediately takes to Pam)
This one time, I accidentally went to
the wrong office, and spent the entire
morning massaging the wrong clients.

PAM
O-kay, and you are…?

MARCI
I’m Marci, your masseuse.
Pam looks at her, puzzled.

MARCI
I’m in the right place, right?

PAM
I…
HOLLY, from Human Resources, steps in.

HOLLY
Of course, Marci. Hi, I’m Holly. We
spoke earlier on the phone.

MARCI
Hi.
They shake hands.

HOLLY
Thanks for coming in.
(beat)
This is Pam, our receptionist. She
always wears the most comfortable
looking sweaters.

PAM
Um, thanks.

HOLLY
I’m sorry, Pam. Didn’t Michael tell you
that Marci was coming today?

PAM
Uh… no. He did not.

HOLLY
I sent him a memo, and he was supposed
to let everyone know about it. Anyway,
Marci’s a masseuse, and she’s going to
be spending the day in the office with
us.

Pam stares at Holly then at Marci, not knowing what to make
of this.

PAM
You’re… going to give us massages?

MARCI
Yup. Trained and certified. I even
brought my own chair.

Pan down to reveal the masseuse’s chair.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
Oh my Lord!

He marches over from his cubby.

MICHAEL
Is it bring a supermodel in to work
day, or did you just wander in here on
your own?

HOLLY
Michael, this is Marci, she’s the-

MICHAEL
Masseuse. I heard.
(extending a hand)
Michael Scott. Regional Manager of
Dunder Mifflin.

They shake hands. Michael holds it longer than necessary.

MARCI
Hi, I’m Marci, the masseuse.
He’s grinning like he’s won the lottery.

MICHAEL
This is quite a surprise.

HOLLY
It wouldn’t have been if you’d read the
memo I sent you.

FLASHBACK:
CLOSE UP. The “memo” she’s referring to has been turned
into a paper airplane, ready to be launched from Michael’s
hand.

Pull back to reveal him hiding behind the door to his
office, stifling a laugh.

He launches it in DWIGHT’S direction.
The paper airplane memo flies a few feet and BOINKS Dwight
in the back of the head.

BACK TO PRESENT:

MICHAEL
Oh, yeah, right, that memo. It must
have gotten shuffled somewhere. Or I
got my dates mixed up.
(beat)
Does Corporate know about this?

HOLLY
Corporate okayed it. In fact, they’re
paying Marci to be here.

MICHAEL
Wow. That is awesome!
(turns to Marci)
So you’re just gonna like…

MARCI
Give you a massage.
MICHAEL
Oh, ho.
(he breaks into giggles)
Just like right here in the office?

MARCI
Well, if you have a room where I can
set up, that would be great. And it
would give us some privacy.

This clearly is the wrong thing to say to Michael, who
starts turning red in the face.

HOLLY
You can use the conference room.

MARCI
Great.

HOLLY
Right this way.
As Holly escorts Marci over, Michael turns to Pam, grinning
like a Cheshire cat.

MICHAEL
I can’t believe it! This is going to be
great!

The look on Pam’s face tells us she doesn’t agree.

PAM TALKING HEAD

PAM
The last time something like this
happened, it was a girl named Katy who
came by the office to sell handbags.
(beat)
She ended up dating Jim.
(beat)
Not that I’m worried or anything. This
was way before we started going out.
It’s just that I’ve never had a massage
before. I don’t know if Jim’s ever had
one either. In fact, I can’t even
picture someone giving him one… or me
one for that matter.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Michael watches Marci set up the massage chair.

MICHAEL
You need any help?

MARCI
No, I got it. Done it a million times.

MICHAEL
So we don’t lie down?

MARCI
This is sit down massage.

MICHAEL
How’s it work?

The chair ready, she demonstrates by sitting in it, putting
her forehead against the headrest.

MARCI
You just sit down in the chair like
this.

MICHAEL
Should I take my clothes off first?

MARCI
Just your jacket. You can keep your
shirt on.

MICHAEL
Oh.

This takes some of the wind out of his sails, but he removes
his jacket and settles into the chair.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As we look at Michael’s face from below the massage chair,
through the opening in the headrest.

MICHAEL
Now what do I do?

MARCI
Just close your eyes and relax.

Michael’s eyes close as instructed.

We can see Marci’s silhouette behind him, as she begins to
rub his shoulders.

His eyes open, and he begins to giggle.

MICHAEL
Whoahoaha.

INT. OFFICE - LATER

The conference room door opens, and Michael steps outside,
looking like a changed man.

MICHAEL
Wow! That was unbelievable! I feel
ten years younger!
(to Marci)
How did you do that?

MARCI
It’s all in the training. Alright,
who’s next?

Phyllis raises a hand.

PHYLLIS
I’ll go.

As she enters the conference room, we pan over to Pam, who
still looks uncomfortable.

Michael approaches her desk.

PAM
How was it?

MICHAEL
Wow. I just can’t stop smiling.
PAM
Um, what did she do?

MICHAEL
She worked her magic, on me!

PAM
Like, where did…

Pam vaguely points around her body.

MICHAEL
Mostly the shoulders, a little neck,
some back, the upper arms.

PAM
And it was… good?

MICHAEL
I can’t even describe it. It was like…
you know the first time you…

PAM
What?

MICHAEL
You know… you…

He makes some vague motions, grinning like a fool.
Pam shakes her head. She still doesn’t get it.
He makes a hip-thrusting motion.
Her eyes widen. She gets it now.

MICHAEL
(leaning in, whispers)
It was like the first time you had sex.
(beat)
Except not quite as good. But close.
We can see that this is too much information for her.

DWIGHT TALKING HEAD

DWIGHT
Am I going to get a massage?
(beat)
No.
(beat)
Why on earth would I turn my back to a
complete stranger, and allow myself to
enter into a relaxed alpha-wave state?
(beat)
It’s just asking for someone to insert
a knife in your back.

INT. OFFICE

We focus on JIM, who goes about his day. He glances over
at the conference room, but sees nothing through the drawn
blinds.
Pan across to Pam, watching him.
He sees her watching.
She quickly looks away.

JIM TALKING HEAD

JIM
I think Pam might be a little
uncomfortable with Marci being here. It
could have something to do with the one
time a girl named Katy stopped by the
office to sell handbags.
(beat)
We went out a few times, but it didn’t
mean anything. In fact, I think Katy’s
in Vermont now.
(beat)
Don’t tell Pam I mentioned that.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The conference room door opens, and Phyllis steps out. She’s
practically glowing.
Marci stands in the doorway.

MARCI
Who’s next?
(looking to Jim)
How about you, Slim?

Jim shakes his head.

JIM
Nah, I’m good. I’ve got a lot of work
to do.

MARCI
You sure? It would only take a few
minutes.

ANDY
I’ll go.

ANDY gets up, and enters the conference room.
We notice Pam observing the exchange.
Jim glances in Pam’s direction.
She pretends to type on her computer.

RECEPTION DESK – LATER

Jim comes over and leans on the counter.

JIM
Hey.

PAM
Hey yourself.

JIM
So uh… business as usual, right?

PAM
Right.

Awkward silence.

PAM
What do you think of Marci?

JIM
Who?

PAM
The masseuse, Marci the masseuse.

JIM
I think there are way too many “M’s” in
that sentence.

Pam finally breaks into a smile.

PAM
So you don’t want one?

JIM
No, I’m good. How about you?

PAM
I can live without a massage.

JIM
You sure? Because Phyllis really seemed
to enjoy hers.

PAM
Well, Phyllis also enjoys doing needlepoint.

JIM
Point taken.

JIM TALKING HEAD

JIM
I went to a masseuse once. It was back
in high school. I used to run crosscountry, and I strained some muscles in
my leg. So Coach had me go to a sports
therapy clinic, and they scheduled me a
visit with the masseuse.
(beat)
He was a big, burly guy named Hans. It
lasted half-an-hour.
(beat)
Longest thirty minutes of my life.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

We look up at Andy through the headrest from below.
He’s clearly enjoying the experience.

ANDY
Oh, wow. You are amazing!

ANDY (cont’d)
Whoa! What is that, a knuckle?

REVERSE ANGLE
To reveal Marci digging into his back with her elbow.

INT. BREAK ROOM

ANGELA microwaves some water for her tea, while Dwight pops
open a can of soda.

ANGELA
I can’t believe that woman is in here,
doing what she’s doing.

DWIGHT
I can’t believe people are letting her.
(he bites into a candy bar)
If this were medieval times it’d be
equivalent to lowering the drawbridge
over the moat, opening the gates, and
letting the enemy just walk right in
and murder everyone in their sleep.

She frowns at him.

DWIGHT
I wouldn’t be surprised if assassins
took on the role of masseuses to lull
their victims into a relaxed state,
thereby making it easier to complete
the job.

ANGELA
What are you talking about?

DWIGHT
What are you talking about?

ANGELA
I’m talking about her.
She points to the conference room.

ANGELA (cont’d)
Macy, or whatever her name is. People
shouldn’t be touching other people that
way. It’s not right.
(beat)
Unless you’re married, or deeply
involved, but even then it should only
be on special occasions.

Pam enters the room.

PAM
Oh, hey guys. I noticed neither of you
have had a massage yet.

ANGELA
And I don’t plan on getting one.
PAM
Me neither.

DWIGHT
I wonder what kind of weapons she can
hide in that chair. It looks big enough
to fit a short sword -- or a pair of
nunchucks.

DWIGHT TALKING HEAD

DWIGHT
As you already know, I’ve stashed weapons
in key strategic locations throughout the
office and if it came down to it, I think
I can take her in hand-to-hand combat.
(beat)
I’m guessing she must be trained and
proficient in multiple fighting arts, as
well as in the use of deadly weapons, but
I have one major advantage.
(beat)
Geography. This is her first time here,
whereas I know this office like the back
of my hand. That gives me the home field
advantage. So bring it on, dragon lady.

INT. BREAK ROOM

It’s just Pam and Angela sitting at a table.

ANGELA
I mean, would you feel comfortable with
some stranger’s hands all over you?
Plus, she’s a woman, so it makes it
even weirder.

PAM
Yeah, I guess.

Holly enters.

HOLLY
Hey. So what do you think of our
masseuse? Have either of you seen her
yet?

Neither says anything.

HOLLY
I take it neither of you have had a
massage before.

PAM
My mom used to give me backrubs when I
was a kid.

ANGELA
Why did Corporate send her here?

HOLLY
It’s part of our new health and wellness
program. If she can relieve some of the
tension and stress we’ve built up, it
might help increase our productivity.

ANGELA
You know what else would increase
productivity?
(beat)
Letting everyone work, and not waste
time visiting Misty for backrubs.

HOLLY
What about you, Pam?

PAM
Um, I… I’m not sure.

HOLLY
It’s not going to kill you.

PAM
I know, it’s just that I’m not sure I’d
feel comfortable.

HOLLY
Okay, but everyone else seems to be
enjoying it, and you do look a little
tense.

She exits, leaving Pam staring out at the conference room.

INT. OFFICE – ACCOUNTING

With Angela gone, we find Andy talking to Oscar and Kevin.

ANDY
Oh my god. Isn’t she incredible?
(to Oscar)
Makes you wish you weren’t gay, right?

KEVIN
I wonder if she’s that kind of
masseuse?

ANDY
What kind?

KEVIN
You know the kind that…
Kevin begins to giggle.

OSCAR
Okay, I’m pretty sure I don’t want to
see where this conversation heads.

He gets up and leaves.

ANDY
You think?

KEVIN
I don’t know. I haven’t had one yet.
What did you think?

ANDY
Well, now that you mention it…

KEVIN
Let’s ask Jim.

INT. OFFICE – CONTINUOUS

ANDY
Yo Tuna!

Jim glances up from his computer.

ANDY
Could you come here for a second, we
have a question for you.

Before he goes, Jim gives the camera a look.
He knows that whatever comes next, is going to border on
stupidity.

INT. ACCOUNTING AREA

ANDY
Kevin and I were just talking about the
masseuse, and whether she gives…

KEVIN
Happy endings.

Kevin giggles uncontrollably.

JIM
O-kay. And I’ve got a lot of work to
do, so bye.

ANDY
Wait, Tuna. You think I should ask her
out?

JIM
That’s up to you.

ANDY
Oh, man. She is gorgeous.
(beat)
Hey, when you go to get a massage, ask
her what she thinks of me.

JIM
I’m not going to get one.

KEVIN
You’re not?

ANDY
Whoa, Tuna, how could you pass up a
free massage? That’s just plain crazy.
(beat)
It’s like if there were free donuts in
the breakroom, would you be like, “nah,
I don’t want one.” Of course not! You’d
be cramming your face with a powdered,
jelly donut.

JIM
No, really, I’m cool.

ANDY
As your friend, I cannot allow you to
pass up this opportunity. You have to
get a massage. If you don’t, you’ll
regret it the rest of your life.

JIM
Okay, I’m leaving now.
He heads back to his desk.

KEVIN
Happy endings.
They simultaneously break into giggles.

INT. MICHAEL’S OFFICE

We find him peering out at the conference room, as Meredith
exits, and Stanley enters for his turn.

MICHAEL TALKING HEAD

MICHAEL
This is like the greatest thing to ever
happen here. I mean, it’s like Christmas
in July, only it’s April.
(beat)
This would never have happened if Toby
were here. And if Corporate did make him
hire a masseuse, he would have gotten one
that was male, and all hairy and gross.
Nothing like Marci who, by the way, I
would so be all over, if it weren’t for
Jan. I mean look at her!

INT. OFFICE

Marci hangs an “I’LL BE BACK IN HALF AN HOUR” sign on the
conference room door.
She goes over to Pam’s desk.

MARCI
Hi, Pam, right?

PAM
Oh, hey Marci. How’s it going?

MARCI
I’ve got half the office done. I’m
thinking of getting some lunch. Are you
doing anything?

PAM
I…

MARCI
C’mon, my treat. I don’t know anyone
else here. Don’t make me eat alone.

PAM
Um, okay.

INT. CAFETERIA

Pam and Marci are seated at a table having lunch.
Marci looks completely at ease, while Pam appears slightly
uncomfortable.

MARCI
So do you like working in the office?

PAM
It’s okay. Um, what about you? Do you
like giving massages?

MARCI
Yeah. Actually, I hope to one day open
my own day spa.

PAM
Really?

MARCI
Sure. You can come in, get your hair
done, get a facial, manicure, pedicure,
then a full body massage. Doesn’t that
sound awesome?

PAM
Uh, yeah, that sounds… great.

MARCI
I know, doesn’t it?
(beat, sizing Pam up)
You would look so good with highlights
in your hair, and a brighter shade of
lip-gloss.

Seeing Marci smiling back at her, with her perfect make-up
and hair, Pam self-consciously looks at her reflection in
the glass.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

Marci’s back in session, and it’s Kelly’s face we see
through the headrest.

KELLY
Oh my god, if you opened a day spa, I
would so totally be there like twentyfour-seven. I love being pampered, and
having stuff done to me. I mean, who
doesn’t, right? I’d even want to work
in one. I can give massages. I used to
give Ryan, my ex-boyfriend, who’s now
in prison, one all the time. Although
I’m not sure I’d want to give everyone
a massage, just the cute ones. I mean I
don’t know how you do it. I see someone
with bad skin, and I think to myself:
there is no way I am touching that.
Maybe if I wore some plastic gloves or
something, you know the kind that
leaves your hands all chalky after you
take them off. What do you think? Do
you ever wear gloves when you massage?

REVERSE ANGLE

To Marci looking down at Kelly with a raised eyebrow.

INT. OFFICE

Kelly exits, and Marci looks around the office.

MARCI
Who can I do next?

Over in accounting, we can hear Kevin giggle.
She turns to Dwight.

MARCI
How about you?

DWIGHT
No thanks.

MARCI
Are you sure.

DWIGHT
Positive.

MARCI
There’s nothing to be afraid of.

DWIGHT
That’s what you say.
She turns her attention to Jim.

MARCI
Slim, you haven’t had one yet.

JIM
Actually, it’s Jim.

ANDY
Slim Jim. Ha. C’mon Tuna, go for it!

JIM
No really, I’m fine.

MICHAEL (O.S.)
C’mon, Jim.

We see him standing in the doorway to his office.

MICHAEL
As your superior I order you to have a
massage.

KEVIN
Slim Jim! Slim Jim! Slim Jim!

The rest of the office joins in the chant.

EVERYONE
Slim Jim! Slim Jim! Slim Jim!

JIM
Okay, fine.

He gets up and heads for the conference room, but before he
goes he steals a glance at Pam, who pretends to be working.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jim enters, looking uncomfortable.

MARCI
I’m sorry it turned into… whatever it
did back there. Is it always like that
here?

JIM
Pretty much. Although things usually
calm down after everyone’s had their
midday nap and juice box.

Marci laughs.

MARCI
I bet you were the class clown, and you
were always playing pranks on people.

JIM
I have been known to pull a prank or
two.

MARCI
Have you ever pulled one on the guy who
sits across from you? He looks like the
kind that’d be really fun to mess with.

Jim breaks into a smile, beginning to relax.

JIM
Well, actually, since you mention it…

INT. OFFICE

Pam stares at the drawn blinds of the conference room, we
can hear Marci’s laughter emanating from inside.
Her expression is troubled.
Kelly interrupts her.

KELLY
Oh my god, Pam! You have got to get a
massage. It’s like heaven. And Marci
is like soooo pretty, right? I’m glad
Ryan’s not here, if he were and we were
like still going out, I don’t know how
I’d feel if he were in there getting a
massage from her. Not that he’d do
anything of course, actually on second
thought, Ryan was kind of a scumbag,
but still… did I mention that Marci
was really pretty?

The look on Pam’s face reveals that this isn’t helping.

INT. OFFICE – LATER

Jim exits and sits down at his desk, looking like nothing’s
happened.
Marci scans the room, settles on Pam.

MARCI
Pam. Your turn.

PAM
Really, it’s okay. You can massage
someone else.

MARCI
C’mon, Pam. I’ve been looking forward
to this all day.

Pam knows she’s trapped.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

We see Pam’s face through the headrest.

MARCI
You really should try and relax. You’re
very tense.

PAM
Sorry.

MARCI
Just close your eyes and pretend you’re
in bed, ready to fall asleep.
Pam closes her eyes, then opens them again.

PAM
So um, what were you and Jim talking
about?

MARCI
What?

PAM
I heard you laughing… a lot.

REVERSE ANGLE

Marci stands over Pam, kneading her shoulders.

MARCI
Jim was just telling me about the times
he pranked Dwight.

PAM
Oh.
(beat)
Did he enjoy his massage?

MARCI
Who?

PAM
Jim.

MARCI
I didn’t give him one.

FROM UNDER THE CHAIR

Pam’s eyes widen.

PAM
What?

REVERSE ANGLE

MARCI
We actually just sat down and talked
the whole time. He made me promise not
to tell anyone; he wants the office to
think he went through with it. Oops. I
guess I spilled. Don’t tell Jim I told
you, okay?

PAM
Um, yeah, sure.

MARCI
Wow. You’re really starting to relax
now. I can feel all the tension just
melting away.

PAM
(starting to enjoy it)
Yeah. This is really nice.

Marci continues the massage.

UNDER THE HEADREST

PAM
I bet you get hit on by a lot of guys.

MARCI
Yeah, it happens sometimes.
(beat)
I usually tell them that I already have
a girlfriend.

Pam’s eyes flash open.

PAM
You… um, you’re…

MARCI
Actually, I just made that up, but it
does get them to back off.

PAM
Oh.
She closes her eyes once more.

MARCI
The truth is… I broke up with my
girlfriend a year ago.

Pam’s eyes flash open again.

INT. OFFICE – END OF THE DAY

We find Marci, with her chair packed and ready to go.

MICHAEL
Well, thank you so much for coming in
today. Everybody, let’s give Marci a
round of applause. C’mon, let’s hear it.

Everyone in the office claps, with the exception of Dwight
and Angela.
As Marci says her goodbyes, we notice Pam at her desk,
looking uncomfortable.
Marci approaches Pam.

MARCI
If you ever change your mind, call me,
okay?

Pam puts on a forced smile, and Marci exits.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING – PARKING LOT

Pam and Jim make their way to their cars.

JIM
So.

PAM
So. That was an interesting day.

JIM
You can say that again.

PAM
How was your massage?

JIM
Great. How was yours?

PAM
It was good.

JIM
You weren’t a little… jealous when I
was in there with Marci, right?

PAM
Absolutely not.

JIM
Really?

PAM
Yeah. I’m sure.

JIM
Okay. But I should let you know that
nothing happened.

PAM
I know.

JIM
Alright, you seem pretty okay with it.

PAM
I am.

JIM
By the way, what was that about?

PAM
What?

JIM
You know, between you and Marci, right
before she left.

PAM
It was nothing.

JIM
C’mon, Beesley.

PAM
You really want to know?

JIM
Yeah.

PAM
Marci’s a lesbian, and she asked me out
on a date.

Close on Jim’s stunned expression.

THE END
